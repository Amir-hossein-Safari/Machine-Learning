# Machine Learning

Welcome to the Machine Learning repository! This project is designed as an educational resource for exploring and learning various machine learning concepts in an interactive way.

## What's Inside?

- **Lecture/**: Contains interactive Jupyter Notebooks with hands-on examples and explanations on different machine learning topics.
- **LICENSE**: Details the MIT License under which this project is available.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed to get started:
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/)
- Key libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, etc.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amir-hossein-Safari/Machine-Learning.git
cd Machine-Learning
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

If you have a `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Otherwise, manually install the needed packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## How to Use

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
